Hi, Larry!

Here is my Patients Project.

Install:
  git clone https://github.com/wangboguo/patients.git
  cd patients
  bundle install
  rake db:migrate
  rake db:seed (to create two locations: 'Test location 1' and 'Test location 2' )

Run:
  rails s
  Then, open your browser to view it at `http://your_host_or_ip_address:3000` (localhost:3000)

Run Test:
  cd patients
  bundle exec rspec spec
